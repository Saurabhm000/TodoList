🧠 How It Works

User adds a task ➜ The task is added to the list and saved in localStorage.

User clicks a task ➜ The task toggles between completed and not completed.

User clicks delete ➜ The task is removed from the list and from localStorage.

Page reloads ➜ The app reads from localStorage and restores the tasks.
